# bikeshare_project
In this project I built a little console application analyzing bikesharing data for some cities.  
<b> What you need to run is the main.py file. </b>  
The tobias_library.py file is for optical purposes and some easy calculations.
To make the script run correctly you need to unpack the 3 .csv files in data.7z.001 into the same folder as the .py files.
